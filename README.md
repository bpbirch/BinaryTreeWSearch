# BinaryTreeWSearch
This module/repo contains a class-based BinaryTree structure. Included in this class are traversal, search, and get methods. Search and get use the traversal methods as arguments, and the results of these searches are actually achieved by changing the state of static variables within BinaryTree. Note that this is NOT a binary search tree data structure. I've implemented that structure in a different module. The search functionality in this structure was just meant to allow a customization of search, using different traversal methods.
